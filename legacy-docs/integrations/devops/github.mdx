How Formal helps you evaluate impact of database migration?

Formal's integration with Github can help you evaluate the potential impact of database migration on data products before they even run.

## How to use it?

1. Install the [Formal Github Application](https://app.joinformal.com/dashboard/integrations/github)
2. Create a new Formal Machine user
3. Create and commit a file called formal.yaml; the file should include the following information:
   - `datastoreId`: the id of the Formal Resource on which the migration is running
   - `sidecarId`: the Github application needs this id to fetch the current alembic version of the app
   - `db`: the demo on which the database migration is running
   - `defaultSchema`: default schema of the db
   - `formalUser`: the machine user you've created previously to let the Github Application fetch the alembic version

The file should look like this:

```yaml
datastoreId: dcbb90f4-7901-4147-aa35-a188592dcdbd
sidecarId: dcbb90f4-7901-4147-aa35-a188592dcdbd
db: demo
defaultSchema: public
formalUser: idp:formal:machine:test-alembic
```

## Result

Then you should see the Formal bot commenting the PR with a report that includes the schema diff.
