How does Formal integrate with your cloud provider?

Formal seamlessly connects with cloud infrastructure to provide comprehensive visibility and control over data resources. Through cloud integration, organizations gain automatic resource discovery and streamlined audit logging:

1. **Resource autodiscovery**: Formal automatically discovers cloud resources (databases, compute instances, etc.) and configures Connectors accordingly. Discovered resources can be viewed in the dashboard, promoted to first-class Formal resources, connected to Connectors and Listeners, and managed through the Resources UI.

2. **Log integrations**: The audit trail is streamlined by forwarding logs from Formal Connectors to preferred logging platforms.

These powerful integrations are available for major providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
