How does Formal integrate with Datahub?

Formal's DataHub integration allows seamless synchronization of data labeling changes between your Formal Data Inventory and DataHub systems, streamlining your data management process.

## Enabling integration

To enable the integration, follow these steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="First Step">
Navigate to the Datahub application.
</Step>
<Step title="Second Step">
Click on `Set up Datahub Integration` button.
</Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
A modal will appear, presenting synchronization options:
**Sync Direction**: - **Bidirectional**: Enables synchronization between Formal and DataHub, regardless of where the modifications were made. - **Formal to DataHub**: Changes made in Formal will be reflected in DataHub. - **DataHub to Formal**: Updates in DataHub will only affect Formal.

    **Generalized Metadata Service URL**:
    Specify the `GeneralizedMetadataService URL` (GSM), which is the URL of your DataHub instance. For example: http://datahub.example.com/api/graphql.

    **API Key**:
    If you have an API key for the GSM instance, provide it. This will be used when Formal communicates with the GSM server.

    **Integration Status (Active):**
    Select Yes under 'Active' to set the integration to currently active.

    **Synced Entities**:
    Specify the 'Synced Entities' to define the types of entities you wish to synchronize. Options include Tags and DataLabels.

  </Step>

## Setting up the DataHub Formal action

Follow these steps to set up the DataHub Formal action:

1. Install the formal-datahub package by running the following command in your terminal:
   `pip install formal-datahub backoff`
2. Create your action file. The file should be structured as follows:

   ```yaml
   name: "datahubToFormal"
   source:
   type: "kafka"
   config:
       connection:
       bootstrap: ${KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER:-localhost:9092}
       schema_registry_url: ${SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL:-http://localhost:8081}

   action:
   type: "formal-datahub.action:FormalAction"
   config:
       webhook_secret: "secret"
       org_id: "org_id"
   ```

   Replace "secret" and "org_id" with the respective values provided in the Formal console.

3. Run the following command to allow Formal to receive updates from your DataHub instance:
   `datahub actions -c action.yaml`

Now, your setup is complete, and Formal will be able to integrate and synchronize with DataHub as needed.
