title: 'Deprecation and End-of-Life (EOL) Policy'
---

## Our Commitment 
At Formal, we are dedicated to providing you with the best products and services. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, there may come a time when certain products or features are deprecated or reach their end-of-life (EOL). This policy outlines how we manage these changes to ensure a smooth transition for our customers.

## Key Principles

- **Advance Notice**: We believe in keeping you informed. You will receive 6 to 12 months of advance notice before any product or feature is deprecated or reaches EOL. This notice period ensures you have ample time to plan and adapt to the changes.

- **Minimum Support Duration**: To maintain reliability and trust, no product or feature will be deprecated or reach EOL within the first 24 months of its release. This guarantees that you have sufficient time to utilize and integrate our offerings into your operations without unexpected interruptions.

## What to Expect

### Notification Timeline

- **Initial Announcement (12 Months Before EOL)**: You will receive a formal notification detailing the upcoming deprecation or EOL. Information will include reasons for the change, the impact on your current usage, and available alternatives or upgrades.

- **Midway Reminder (6 Months Before EOL)**: A reminder will be sent to ensure you are aware of the upcoming changes. Additional resources and support options will be highlighted to assist in the transition.

- **Final Reminder (1 Month Before EOL)**: A final notification will confirm the effective date of deprecation or EOL. Last opportunities to migrate to alternative solutions will be provided.

### Communication Channels
We utilize multiple channels to ensure you receive timely and comprehensive information:

- **Email Notifications**: Direct updates to your registered email address.
- **Product Dashboards**: In-app announcements and banners.
- **Slack Notifications**: Direct messages to our shared Slack channel.
- **Support Portals**: Accessible information through our customer support channels.

### Support During Transition

- **Technical Support**: Continued support and maintenance will be available throughout the notice period to assist you with any issues or questions.
- **Migration Assistance**: We offer resources, documentation, and personalized support to help you transition to alternative products or upgraded versions seamlessly.
- **Training and Resources**: Access to webinars, tutorials, and FAQs to facilitate your adaptation to new solutions.

### Exceptional Circumstances
In rare cases, such as critical security vulnerabilities or regulatory requirements, the deprecation or EOL timeline may be expedited. However, we strive to provide as much notice as possible and work closely with you to minimize any disruptions.

## Our Promise
- **Transparency**: Clear and honest communication about product changes.
- **Support**: Dedicated assistance to ensure a smooth transition.
- **Reliability**: Commitment to maintaining high standards throughout the product lifecycle.
