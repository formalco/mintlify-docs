title: "How to receive alert of triggered policies?"
---


When a policy is triggered, Formal has built a notification system to keep you informed.

Formal enables you to receive notifications each time one of your policies is triggered by a data consumer.

## Setup notification

In order to set the notification system for policies, you have 3 options:
1. Alert owners only: only the owners of the policy will receive the notification.
2. Alert consumers only: only the data consumers triggering the policy will receive the notification.
3. Alert owners and consumers: both owners and data consumers will receive the notification.

<CardInfo>By default, Formal will send notifications via email. </CardInfo>

### Terraform example

Here is an example of a policy alerting consumers.

```hcl
resource "formal_policy" "mask_emails" {
  name         = "mask-email"
  description  = "Mask any column that has the data label email_address."
  owners       = "john@company.com"
  notification = "consumer"
  status       = "draft"
  module       = <<-EOF
package formal.v2

import future.keywords.if

post_request := { "action": "mask", "type": "redact.partial", "sub_type": "email_mask_username", "columns": columns, "typesafe": "fallback_to_default" } if {
    columns := [col | col := input.columns[_]; col["data_label"] == "email_address";]
}
EOF
}
```

## Receive notification on Slack

Formal has just-in-time access feature built on top of Slack. After [installing Formal to your Slack workspace](/integrations/chatops/slack), Formal will automatically alert owners or consumers on Slack.
