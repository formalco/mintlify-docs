How to create a native user for your resource?

Formal Users and Groups can be assigned a Native User. The Connector will utilize this user when the end user is connecting to a Resource.

Formal Users and Groups can only be assigned one Native User. If a Formal Group is assigned a Native User, all the Formal Users within it will be assigned that Native User.

To avoid ambiguity, a Formal User that has a Native User assignment cannot be added to a Formal Group that also has a Native User assignment: the user's assignment must be removed first. This is a safety measure to ensure purposeful intent when privileges are modified.

## Create a native user

1. Navigate to the Resources app. In the list of Resources, click on the arrow at the end of the row corresponding to the desired Resource to which you wish to create a native user.

## Configure the password of the native user

To configure the password of the native users, customers have 4 options:

### Password-based authentication

1. Set directly the password, Formal will keep it encrypted in the control plane and send it in the configuration of the Connectors.
2. Set it via an environment variable. You can specify the following value in the secret: `ENV:NAME_OF_THE_ENV_VARIABLE_WITH_THE_PASSWORD_OF_THE_USER`
   <Warning>
     Please make sure that the environment variable is set in the connector's
     deployment.
   </Warning>

### IAM authentication

3. Set the value `iam` for the secret, the Connector will attempt to connect via the IAM role of the running environment. You need to make sure that the Connector has the required permissions.
4. Use IAM authentication with a custom role, the Connector will assume the specified IAM role to connect to the Resource. The value should be the ARN of the IAM role.

## Determine a native user for a Formal User or Group

You can assign a Native User to a Formal User or Group. This will override the default native user configured for the Resource.

1. Navigate to the list of native users in the details of the Resource.
