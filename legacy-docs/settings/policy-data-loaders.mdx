How to manage Formal Policy Data Loaders?

## Overview

Policy Data Loaders extend the capabilities of Formal Policies by enabling you to load data from external sources and use it in your Policies, with your own code using your favorite programming language.

They require the deployment of a Policy Data Loader Satellite and the configuration of your Connectors to use that Satellite. The deployment steps are outlined in the [Satellites Deployment](/deploying-a-satellite/deployment) documentation.

Their code run on a schedule, fetch data from external sources, output the data as JSON, effectively making it available to your Policies through the `data` object.

## Key

Data fetched by Policy Data Loaders is accessible in your Policies through the `data` object using the key you define.

For example, if you have a Policy Data Loader with the key `my_custom_data`, you can access the data in your policies using `data.my_custom_data`.

## Schedule

Policy Data Loaders run at a specific interval, which you can configure. The format used is a second-based "cron" expression.

For example: 

* `* * * * * *` runs every second.
* `*/30 * * * * *` runs every 30 seconds.
* `0 * * * * *` runs every minute.
* `0 */5 * * * *` runs every 5 minutes.
* `0 30 8 * * *` runs every day at 8:30.

As you can see, each field represents a different time unit, from seconds to years: `second minute hour day month year`. Slash (`/`) is used to specify intervals, and asterisk (`*`) is used to specify all values.

## Runtime

Policy Data Loaders run in a separate process within the Satellite environment, meaning that your code can be written in any language that is supported by the Satellite.

We currently support the following runtimes:

| Name        | Identifier   | Available libraries |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Node.js 18  | `nodejs18.x` | `lodash`, `axios`   |
| Python 3.11 | `python3.11` | `requests`, `httpx` |


## Status

A Policy Data Loader can have two different statuses:
* `Draft`: The Policy Data Loader is not running.
* `Active`: The Policy Data Loader is running and fetching data.

## Code

The code of a Policy Data Loader is written in the runtime you choose and is executed as a new process in the Satellite environment. It can access any environment variable that the Satellite has been deployed with.

It must output the data as a valid JSON so that the Satellite can handle it and make it available to your Policies.
