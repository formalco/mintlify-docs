How to manage Formal Satellites?

## Overview

Formal Satellites are specialized tools that you can deploy along Connectors to enable advanced use cases.

## Connected Instances
Every 5 minutes, the Satellite sends a log with its version to ensure it is still healthy and to inform about the current version of the Satellite.

You can see the connected and active Satellite instances, along with the instance id, launch time, and the version they are running, on the details page of each Satellite.

## Discovery Tasks

The Data Discovery Satellite is responsible for discovering and analyzing schemas of your Resources.

You can see the list of tasks that have been or are executed by the Satellite and their respective status.

## API Key

Every Satellite needs an API Key to authenticate with the platform using the `FORMAL_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY` environment variable. The API key is automatically generated and you can get it from the details page of each Satellite.
