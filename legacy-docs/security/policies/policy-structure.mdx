title: "Policy Structure"

This document describes the structure of policies in Formal.

## Standard fields

Every policy in Formal consists of these essential components:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the policy. No two policies can share the same name.
- **Description**: A clear explanation of the policy's purpose and scope.
- **Owners**: The administrators responsible for maintaining and enforcing the policy.
- **Code**: The policy logic, written in [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), a purpose-built language for access control policies.

## Notifications

With our Slack and email integrations, you can configure notifications to be sent when policies are triggered. Choose from these options:

- **None**: No notifications are sent
- **Consumer**: Notify the user who triggered the policy
- **Owners**: Notify the policy owners
- **All**: Notify both the user and policy owners

## Status

Each policy has one of three possible states:

- **Active**: The policy is currently enforced and actively monitoring for violations.
- **Dry-run**: The policy logs violations without enforcing them. This mode is ideal for testing and gathering stakeholder feedback before full enforcement.
- **Draft**: The policy is under development and not yet ready for testing or enforcement.
