Formal enables your teams to find, understand and trust your data.

Formal empowers your teams to discover, understand, and trust your data by providing a comprehensive data catalog that syncs metadata across your entire data stack integrated with Formal.

## Discovery

Formal can discovers the schema of your data in two ways.

### Discovery via Select Queries

Discovery in Formal is an automatic process that occurs when you perform select queries on a table or schema. This behavior ensures that the schema of the resources is fetched and updated as necessary, facilitating the discovery of new tables or changes in the schema. This process happens by default when you query data through the proxy, making it seamless for users to keep their data catalog up to date.

### Discovery via scheduled job

In addition to automatic discovery via select queries, Formal allows you to set up a discovery job with a frequency of your choosing, such as every 24 hours. This provides control over when and how often the discovery process runs, ensuring that your schema is up-to-date without overwhelming your database with frequent scans. The available frequencies for the discovery job include:

- Six hours
- Twelve hours
- Eighteen hours
- Twenty-four hours

You can also configure how to manage deletion. You can mark for deletion which will delete the schema if it does not exist in the database and then it will be up to you to delete it from Formal UI.

## Data labelling

Formal allows you to understand what your organization's data is comprised of by automatically labeling the data.

### Data labels using Formal LLM Classification

### Create a new label

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">Navigate to the `Inventory` application</Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Click on the `Settings` icon in the top right corner
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    Click on `Manage Data Labels`
    <img height="100" src="/assets/images/create_new_label_1.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Click on `New Label`
    <img height="100" src="/assets/images/create_new_label_2.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fifth Step">
    Enter the name of your label, select the classifier type (`Regex` or
    `Prompt`), and provide the classifier data. For the classifier data: -
    `Regex`: Enter a valid regular expression for regex type. - `Prompt`:
    Provide a comma-separated list of example values for prompt type.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Locking a label

When the Label is **locked**, it means that Formal will stop attempting a new classification and only use the provided label. You can lock a label by enabling the radio button `Lock label`.

<img height="100" src="/assets/images/formal_label_locked.png" />

<CardInfo>
  The `/inventory` API endpoint provides the nested structure of the Inventory
  only, while the `/inventory/flat` endpoint provides a flattened array of each
  `Inventory` Object with full details.
</CardInfo>

## Custom tags

Formal allows you to create your own **custom tags** and apply them to columns within Formal's Inventory.

<img height="100" src="/assets/images/formal_tags.png" />

### How to create a custom tag

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">Navigate to the `Inventory` application</Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Click on the `Settings` icon in the top right corner
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    Click on `Manage Custom Tags`
    <img height="100" src="/assets/images/create_custom_tag_1.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Click on `Create new tag` button
    <img height="100" src="/assets/images/create_custom_tag_2.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fifth Step">
    Enter the name of your tag
    <img height="100" src="/assets/images/create_custom_tag_3.png" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once created, you can apply the tag to any column in your inventory:

1. Navigate to the column you want to tag
2. Add a new tag by clicking on the dropdown under the column `Tags`
3. Select your custom tag from the dropdown menu

<CardInfo>
  Tags help organize and categorize your data inventory. Use them to group
  related columns, mark sensitive data, or create custom classifications that
  match your organization's needs.

## Synchronize your data catalog

Data catalog synchronization with Formal is bidirectional, supporting a unified platform while maintaining modularity. If you have invested in existing tools, there's no need to replace them, as Formal supports integration with your current setup.

### Datahub

Formal's DataHub integration enables you to sync tags and data labeling changes between your Formal Data Inventory and DataHub, streamlining your data management process. You can decide which entities you want to synchronize, including `Tags` and` Data labels`.

More information on how to connect Datahub to Formal [here](/integrations/data-catalog/datahub).

#### Entities

Formal allows you to decide which entites you want to synchronize:

1. `Tags`: informal, loosely controlled labels that help in search and discovery attached to columns
2. `Data labels`: predicted types for columns
