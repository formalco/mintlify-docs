The Formal Connector can streamline access and control of MongoDB databases.

## Requirements

### Networking

Certain ports must be accessible to connect to Formal Resources. You can listen on multiple ports simultaneously for various Resources.

For accessing MongoDB, you may assign any port except 8080 (Connector's health check port). Ensure your security groups are configured to allow traffic on the designated port.

### Database health check

Formal periodically assesses the health of the database. We test the connection to the `admin` database (`authSource` and `defaultauthdb` [are not specified by default in our generated URI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)).

## Connect to MongoDB

### mongosh

To connect using `mongosh`, execute the following command:

```
mongosh --host HOSTNAME_OF_CONNECTOR:PORT -u 'idp:formal:human:john@joinformal.com'
```

You can also specify a MONGO_URI directly:

```
mongosh 'mongodb://HOSTNAME_OF_CONNECTOR:PORT/' -u 'FORMAL_USERNAME'
```

Make sure to replace HOSTNAME_OF_THE_CONNECTOR, PORT, DATABASE_NAME, AND FORMAL_USERNAME with the right values. To learn more about users, check out [Native Users](/adding-resource/native-users).

<CardInfo>You are free to use any preferred client.</CardInfo>

## Smart Routing

Formal MongoDB features Smart Routing, allowing the linkage of an unlimited number of Resources over the same port (e.g. 27017).

Provide the name of the resource following the database name:

```
mongosh 'mongodb://HOSTNAME_OF_CONNECTOR:PORT/?appName=formal_resource_name=RESOURCE_NAME'
```
