Formal has a Desktop App to 10x developer experience.

Formal Desktop App simplifies connecting to a Resource, making it more accessible to end-users.

It is an agent with a command-line interface (CLI) that automates fetching an access token and establishing a connection. The app is currently available only on macOS and Linux.

## Installation

Download and install the app for the correct platform.
  - [MacOS](https://static-assets.formalcloud.net/desktop-app/darwin/formal.pkg)
  - [Ubuntu/Debian Linux (x86_64)](https://static-assets.formalcloud.net/desktop-app/linux/formal-desktop_0.1.4_amd64.deb)
  - [Ubuntu/Debian Linux (ARM64)](https://static-assets.formalcloud.net/desktop-app/linux/formal-desktop_0.1.4_arm64.deb)
  - For NixOS, we have an overlay and installation instructions in the [formalco/formal-overlay](https://github.com/formalco/formal-overlay) repository.

On MacOS, open the `.pkg` file, follow the installation instructions, and allow the requested permissions.

On Ubuntu/Debian, use `sudo apt install <formal.deb>` to install the file. You will also need to run `systemctl start --user formal` to start the Formal agent.

## Push Formal Desktop App to your MDM

In order to push Formal Desktop App to your entire organization, you can push it to your MDM by downloading the [.pkg](https://static-assets.formalcloud.net/desktop-app/darwin/formal.pkg) and adding it as a custom app on your MDM solution.

## Setup

1. Launch the Formal app (you can use Spotlight on MacOS or the `.desktop` file on Linux) - if itâ€™s running, you should see the Formal logo appear in your system tray.
2. If you're on **MacOS**, you need to install the CLI into your path. Click on the logo in the system tray, hover over `Preferences` and click `Install in PATH`.
3. Open a terminal and run the `formal` command to check that it has been added to path.
4. If you get an error such as `command not found` you have two options:
  - Run the following command: `sudo ln -s /Applications/Formal.app/Contents/MacOS/formal /usr/local/bin/formal`
  - If the above does not work, you can add an alias to your shell config (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.): `alias formal="/Applications/Formal.app/Contents/MacOS/formal"`
5. Run `formal auth login` to log in to Formal.
6. You can now run `formal ls` to list all the Resources for your organization.
7. You can either connect to a resource by using the TUI in `formal ls`, or `formal connect [resource]`. A lightweight proxy will be launched on your machine on the specified port.
8. You can now connect to the resource with the appropriate tool (ex. `psql` for PostgreSQL). Make sure to specify the appropriate host (`localhost`) and port. See the [usage](usage.md) page for more information.

## Troubleshooting

1. Application not running

```
WARNING: CLI cannot connect to the Formal app. Please make sure the Formal app is running.
```

Ensure that Formal agent is launched and visible in your system tray.
