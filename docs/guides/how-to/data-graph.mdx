## Overview

Formal automatically builds a comprehensive graph of data access across your organization, showing who accesses what resources, when, and how.

## Coming Soon

The Data Access Graph visualization feature is currently in development. It will provide:

- **Real-time visibility** into all data access patterns
- **User-to-resource mappings** showing which users access which databases
- **Query pattern analysis** identifying common and unusual access patterns
- **Group-based views** understanding team data usage
- **Resource popularity metrics** which databases/tables are accessed most
- **Anomaly detection** spotting unusual access patterns

## Current Capabilities

While the visual graph UI is in development, you can analyze data access using:

### Logs Aggregation

1. Go to [Logs](https://app.joinformal.com/logs)
2. Switch to **Aggregation Mode**
3. Group by:
   - `user.email` - See which users are most active
   - `resource.name` - Identify hottest resources
   - `table_names` - Most queried tables

### API Access

Query the Formal API for programmatic access graph analysis:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $FORMAL_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.joinformal.com/v1/logs?query=*&group_by=user.email,resource.name"
```
